# -Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a predictive model for detecting diabetes using patient data and machine learning techniques. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on various health-related features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and family medical history.
